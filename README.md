# RSSNotify

There are a few RSS feeds I watch where I would like to receive a notification when new articles are posted with certain titles. There doesn't seem to be many apps that provide this functionality, so I created it myself with python and PushBullet. I currently have this running on a headless raspberry pi board.

If you decide you want to run this script as well for some reason, you'll need to install a few python libraries. Just run the install.sh script to install them all with pip in one command.
